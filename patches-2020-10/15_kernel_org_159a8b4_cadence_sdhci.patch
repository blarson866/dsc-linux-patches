Subject: [PATCH] mmc: sdhci-cadence: use struct_size() helper

One of the more common cases of allocation size calculations is finding
the size of a structure that has a zero-sized array at the end, along
with memory for some number of elements for that array. For example:

struct sdhci_cdns_priv {
	...
        struct sdhci_cdns_phy_param phy_params[0];
};

Make use of the struct_size() helper instead of an open-coded version
in order to avoid any potential type mistakes.

So, replace the following form:

sizeof(*priv) + sizeof(priv->phy_params[0]) * nr_phy_params

with:

struct_size(priv, phy_params, nr_phy_params)

Also, notice that, in this case, variable priv_size is not necessary,
hence it is removed.

This code was detected with the help of Coccinelle.
